"""Multi-day scenarios for the reg-date incremental "big search" endpoints:
concesiones_busqueda, ayudasestado_busqueda, minimis_busqueda, and
partidospoliticos_busqueda. Runs through every cascade window
(daily/weekly/monthly/annual).

The interesting behavior here isn't insert/touch/rewrite in isolation,
which is covered generically in test_scd2.py. It's the cascade: daily only
looks at yesterday, so a correction to a record registered 20 days ago is
invisible to daily and weekly, and only a monthly (or annual) pass catches
it. That's the whole reason the official BDNS guidance recommends running
all four cadences instead of just daily, and it's what these tests prove
end to end against real-shaped payloads.

It's also where window-scoped deletion detection is exercised end to end
(the unit-level proof lives in test_scd2.py). concesiones_busqueda,
ayudasestado_busqueda, and minimis_busqueda each expose their own
registration-date field in the payload, confirmed live against the real
API, so they detect a real deletion the moment it falls inside the
currently-run window. partidospoliticos_busqueda doesn't expose that field
(also confirmed live, despite the official doc claiming otherwise), so it
never detects deletions, same as before this feature existed.

Each fixture record carries `reg_days_ago` (see tests/fake_client.py):
0 means inside daily; 5 means inside weekly but outside daily; 20 means
inside monthly but outside weekly; 100 means inside annual but outside
monthly.
