"""Shared plumbing for the multi-day scenario tests (test_timeline_*.py).

Every scenario test scripts a sequence of simulated sync runs ("days")
against a `FakeBDNSClient` seeded from real, anonymized BDNS payloads
(tests/fixtures/), mutating the client's in-memory data between runs the
same way the real upstream data changes between cron runs: a field edited,
a row withdrawn, a new row registered.
