[🇪🇸 Spanish version](./README.md)

Sync engine that maintains a local, versioned (SCD2) copy of the [Spanish National Subsidies Database (BDNS) REST API](https://www.infosubvenciones.es/bdnstrans/api).

It builds on [`bdns-fetch`](https://github.com/cruzlorite/bdns-fetch), which implements data extraction from the API; `bdns-sync` adds the storage layer: historical versioning, change and deletion detection, and run logging.

It is a single-purpose tool: each invocation syncs one endpoint, with no configuration file. Scheduling cadence lives in [`scripts/delta_load.sh`](scripts/delta_load.sh).

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 to 3.14
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- A SQLAlchemy-compatible target database (see [Target databases](#target-databases))

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cruzlorite/bdns-sync.git
cd bdns-sync
poetry install
```

## Usage

The target is configured through the `BDNS_SYNC_TARGET_URL` environment variable (a SQLAlchemy URL):

```bash
export BDNS_SYNC_TARGET_URL="bigquery://project/dataset"   # or postgresql://..., sqlite:///...
```

Main commands:

```bash
bdns-sync list --kind full                                    # list full-replace entities
bdns-sync list --kind search                                  # list incremental entities
bdns-sync sync sectores                                       # sync a catalog entity
bdns-sync sync concesiones_busqueda --window daily            # incremental window sync
bdns-sync sync concesiones_busqueda --since 2020-01-01        # historical load (through yesterday)
bdns-sync sync concesiones_busqueda --since 2020-01-01 --until 2020-12-31
```

## Target databases

All sync logic uses portable SQL (correlated `EXISTS`/`NOT EXISTS` subqueries, no engine-specific `MERGE` or `UPDATE ... FROM`), so any database with a SQLAlchemy dialect works as a target. Verified:

| Target | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SQLite | Verified (full test suite) | No extra setup |
| BigQuery | Verified (live, full SCD2 cycle) | Driver bundled as a dependency; see below |
| PostgreSQL / MySQL | Compatible by design (portable SQL) | Install the driver (`psycopg2`, `pymysql`, ...) |

Storage sits behind a `Sink` interface ([`bdns/sync/sinks/`](bdns/sync/sinks/)): the fetch layer hands over batches of records and the sink owns everything else (SCD2 versioning, deletion detection, run logging). The current implementation is [`SQLSink`](bdns/sync/sinks/sql/__init__.py), covering any engine with a SQLAlchemy dialect; per-engine differences are confined to its internal adapters ([`bdns/sync/sinks/sql/dialects.py`](bdns/sync/sinks/sql/dialects.py)). A future non-SQL target (e.g. Parquet) would be another `Sink` implementation, leaving the fetch layer untouched.

### BigQuery

```bash
export BDNS_SYNC_TARGET_URL="bigquery://<project>/<dataset>"
```

- **Authentication**: application default credentials (`gcloud auth application-default login`) or a service account via `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`.
- **Minimum permissions**: `roles/bigquery.dataEditor` on the dataset and `roles/bigquery.jobUser` on the project.
- **Indexes**: BigQuery has no secondary indexes; the adapter skips them and tables are created with `CLUSTER BY (_natural_key, _is_current)` instead, the columns every SCD2 diff filters on.

## Scheduled operation

Continuous operation requires a single cron line. The `delta_load.sh` script decides internally which entities and windows to run each day (daily, weekly, monthly, and annual cadence):

```
0 2 * * * BDNS_SYNC_TARGET_URL=bigquery://project/dataset /path/to/repo/scripts/delta_load.sh
```

Before starting the cron job, run the initial historical load once:

```
BDNS_SYNC_TARGET_URL=bigquery://project/dataset /path/to/repo/scripts/full_load.sh
```

The load is idempotent: re-running it does not duplicate data.

## Data model

Each synced endpoint has its own table, and all tables share the same generic schema, with no endpoint-specific fields. The original record is stored whole in `payload`; the remaining columns are SCD2 control columns:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `_natural_key` | The record's business key (JSON of the key fields; see the entity tables below). Together with `_valid_from` it identifies each version |
| `_row_hash` | SHA-256 of the canonical payload; detects changes without comparing field by field |
| `_valid_from` / `_valid_to` | Validity span of this version. `_valid_to` is `NULL` while it is the current version |
| `_is_current` | `True` on the current version of each natural key |
| `_synced_at` | Last time this version was observed at the source (updated even when nothing changed) |
| `_reg_date` | The payload's own registration date. Only populated for entities with window-scoped deletion detection; `NULL` otherwise |
| `payload` | The full record exactly as returned by the API, serialized as JSON (text column, portable across engines) |

If the API adds or removes a field, no migration is required: the change is detected via the hash and versioned like any other.

### Control tables

Shared across all endpoints, with the `_sync_` prefix:

- **`_sync_state`**: one row per table, holding the watermark: `table_name`, `last_synced_at`, `last_run_id`.
- **`_sync_runs`**: append-only log of every run: `run_id`, `table_name`, `run_type` (`full` or `daily`/`weekly`/`monthly`/`annual`), `started_at`/`finished_at`, `status` (`running`/`success`/`failed`), `error`, and the counters `rows_fetched`, `rows_inserted`, `rows_soft_deleted`, and `rows_skipped`.
- **`_sync_errors`**: one row per discarded malformed record: `error_id`, `run_id`, `table_name`, `context`, `content` (truncated to 200 characters), `occurred_at`. See [Known limitations](#known-limitations).

## Endpoint types

There are two families, determined by data volume.

### Full replace (`bdns-sync sync <entity>`)

Small catalogs, where fetching the complete set on every run is affordable.

| Shape | Reason | Entities |
|---|---|---|
| Simple | A single call, no parameters | `sectores`, `actividades`, `finalidades`, `beneficiarios`, `instrumentos`, `objetivos`, `convocatorias_ultimas`, `regiones` |
| Swept | The API does not return the union when the parameter is omitted; each value must be queried and the results merged into one table | `organos`/`organos_agrupacion` (sweep `idAdmon`), `reglamentos` (sweeps `ambito`), `sanciones_busqueda` |
| Discover-then-detail | The listing does not include every field | `planesestrategicos_busqueda`/`planesestrategicos`/`planesestrategicos_vigencia`, `grandesbeneficiarios_anios`/`grandesbeneficiarios_busqueda` |

### Registration-date incremental (`bdns-sync sync <entity> --window {daily,weekly,monthly,annual}`)

Endpoints with tens of millions of rows, where full replacement is not viable.

| Entity | Natural key |
|---|---|
| `concesiones_busqueda` | `id` |
| `ayudasestado_busqueda` | `idConcesion` |
| `minimis_busqueda` | `idConcesion` |
| `partidospoliticos_busqueda` | `id` |
| `convocatorias_busqueda` | `numeroConvocatoria` |
| `convocatorias` | `codigoBDNS` |

`convocatorias` is a two-step case: discovery queries the `convocatorias_busqueda` listing by date range to collect the codes registered in the window, and each discovered code is then fetched in full through the detail endpoint (`convocatorias`, by `numConv`). The detail record is what gets versioned into the `convocatorias` table; the discovery listing is also synced as its own table, `convocatorias_busqueda`, through the same incremental machinery as the rest of this section.

`convocatorias_busqueda` does **not** replace `convocatorias`: the listing carries only 10 of the ~30 detail fields (no budget, application dates, documents, instruments, etc.), and its hash staying the same says nothing about whether a detail-only field changed. Never use the listing to decide whether a code's detail fetch can be skipped.

The detail step of `convocatorias` is the expensive one: one real API call per discovered code, with no pagination possible (a single call returns a single record). Measured live with a real month (May 2026, 6,186 codes), running it sequentially took anywhere from 23 minutes to 3 h 12 min depending on server load. The detail step is parallelized (8 workers, request starts paced at ~9.5 req/s, just under the 10/s cap) to approach the official rate limit instead of being bound to single-connection latency; the same month took 10 min 54 s in parallel, with zero `429`s.

A record's registration date does not change when the record is edited, so re-querying the same window later finds no new additions, but does detect edits via the hash. Corrections cluster near the registration date and taper off with age; hence the window cascade: every level reaches back to yesterday (`window_bounds`), so `annual ⊃ monthly ⊃ weekly ⊃ daily` on any given day. `scripts/delta_load.sh` runs only the widest one that applies that day (annual on Jan 1st, monthly on the 1st, weekly on Sunday, daily otherwise), never stacked: the widest already covers the narrower ones entirely, so stacking would just re-fetch and re-diff the same range twice for no extra detection.

## Date windows and historical load

Date handling against the API involves several subtleties verified live, documented in detail in [docs/api-behavior.en.md](docs/api-behavior.en.md). Summary:

- A window is a day range inclusive on both ends; the upper end is always yesterday.
- The API has two families of date parameters with **opposite** upper-bound semantics (exclusive for `fechaRegFin`, inclusive for `fechaHasta`). The conversion is centralized in `generic.to_api_upper_bound`.
- Every window is chunked into pieces of at most 7 days before being queried, for reliability and speed. The result does not depend on chunk size.
- Boundary correctness (no overlaps and no gaps between consecutive days) is verified live across all 5 entities and fixed as a permanent test.
- Four of the five incremental entities also detect real deletions, by comparing the fetched data against the table rows whose registration date falls in the same range.

The cascade windows reach at most 365 days back. For a full historical load, use `--since DATE [--until DATE]`, which runs through exactly the same machinery. The available historical depth depends on the API's retention per endpoint, from ~4 years (`concesiones_busqueda`) to ~12 (`convocatorias`); [`scripts/full_load.sh`](scripts/full_load.sh) already includes conservative per-entity start dates. See the full table in [docs/api-behavior.en.md](docs/api-behavior.en.md#6-historical-depth-per-endpoint).

## Official good practices

The design follows the official ["Buenas prácticas API SNPSAP"](https://www.infosubvenciones.es/bdnstrans/estaticos/ayuda/Buenas%20pr%C3%A1cticas%20API%20SNPSAP.pdf) document:

- **10 requests per second per IP limit**, enforced by `bdns-fetch`.
- **Maximum page size** (10,000 records per call).
- **Daily/weekly/monthly/annual cadence by registration date**, as the document recommends.
- **The `terceros` endpoint is not used**: the document itself flags it as redundant.
- **Reconciliation to detect removals**: grants are withdrawn from the BDNS 4 calendar years after being awarded. Full-catalog syncs detect removals by comparing against the entire current state; for the large incremental endpoints, where that comparison is not viable, a registration-date-scoped comparison is used instead (see [docs/api-behavior.en.md](docs/api-behavior.en.md#5-window-scoped-deletion-detection)).

## Known limitations

- `organos_codigo` and `organos_codigoadmin` are not implemented (group H).
- `partidospoliticos_busqueda` has no deletion detection: unlike the other four incremental entities, its payload does not expose any registration-date field (verified live; see [docs/api-behavior.en.md](docs/api-behavior.en.md#5-window-scoped-deletion-detection)).
- Individual malformed records are discarded with a log warning (WARNING level), counted in `_sync_runs.rows_skipped`, and recorded in `_sync_errors` (context plus content truncated to 200 characters, linked by `run_id`). They are never stored in the synced tables: without a valid natural key they cannot be versioned like a normal row.
- Multi-year date ranges requested in a single call fail intermittently on the API side (`ERR_MANTENIMIENTO_BBDD`). For that reason every query is chunked into 7-day pieces, including the historical load with `--since`; no manual chunking is needed.
- Staging does not deduplicate: if the same record enters a run's batch twice, it produces two identical current versions of the same natural key. The API and the date chunking are verified live as duplicate-free (8,086/8,086 distinct keys in an exact replica of the production fetch), so this does not happen in normal operation; the one observed case came from a zombie process writing into another run's staging. A preventive `SELECT DISTINCT` on version insertion is pending as hardening.
