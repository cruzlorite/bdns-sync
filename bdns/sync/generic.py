    treat `fechaRegFin` as EXCLUSIVE: it matches registrations strictly

    returned the whole day (~58,000 for concesiones). Left as a bare
    `fechaRegFin=end`, `daily` (start == end) fetches almost nothing, and
    every wider window silently drops its most recent day per chunk.

    made on `inclusive_end`, ask the API for the day after. This is the only
    place that crosses from our inclusive convention to the API's half-open
    one -- keep it here, not inlined as a `+ 1` at call sites.
